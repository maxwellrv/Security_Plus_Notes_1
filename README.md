# Security_Plus_Notes_1

In addition to my journey with Python, I have also decided to embark down the road of earning my CompTIA Security+ certification. This new page of my life has so far been both exciting and challenging. As I dive into the intricacies of cybersecurity, I’m reminded of just how crucial this knowledge is in today’s digital landscape. With cyber threats on the rise, understanding security principles isn't just a benefit — it's a necessity for anyone looking to protect data and maintain the integrity of systems. 

Also, the Security+ knowledge prerequisites are essentially minimal (although having prior knowledge in networking can help significantly). As a result, any individual is allowed a more feasible option for building a knowledge base that they can apply to building their own career in cybersecurity.

Throughout my studies, I plan to document my progress and share my notes here on the blog. Therefore, whether you’re seeking an additional study reference or simply curious about the topics I’m learning, I invite you to join me on this journey. That said, I must emphasize the importance of using officially licensed materials as your primary study resources. While my notes will provide additional support, they are not a substitute for the comprehensive content offered by accredited sources. So, let’s get started on this path to certification together!
